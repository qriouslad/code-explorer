Fast directory explorer and file/code viewer with syntax highlighting.

## Description

Code Explorer allows you to swiftly browse through the directories and files in your WordPress installation. A good alternative to a full-fledged [File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/) if your primary focus is **viewing directory content and the code inside the files** for your dev work, e.g. WordPress core files or theme/plugins files. 

It uses [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) to **highlight code syntax in files** commonly used throughout the WordPress development cycle such as PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, JSON and Markdown files. Code Explorer is based on the [Simple File Manager](https://github.com/jcampbell1/simple-file-manager) library by [John Campbell](https://github.com/jcampbell1).
