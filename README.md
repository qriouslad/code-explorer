Fast directory explorer and file/code viewer with syntax highlighting.

## Description

Code Explorer allows you to swiftly browse through the directories and files in your WordPress installation. A good alternative for [File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-file-manager/), [Filester - File Manager Pro](https://wordpress.org/plugins/filester/) and [Advanced File Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/file-manager-advanced/) if your primary focus is viewing directory content and the code in files for your dev work. It uses [prism.js](https://prismjs.com/) to highlight code syntax in files commonly used throughout the WordPress development cycle such as PHP, HTML, Javascript, CSS, JSON and Markdown files.

Code Explorer is based on the [Simple File Manager](https://github.com/jcampbell1/simple-file-manager) library by [John Campbell](https://github.com/jcampbell1).
